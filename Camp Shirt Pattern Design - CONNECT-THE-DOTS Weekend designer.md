](https://wkdesigner.wordpress.com/2007/09/14/connect-the-dots/shirt1/ "shirt1")_How about an adult version of “connect-the-dots” to create some men’s wear? Sometimes know__n as_ _a tropical shirt, Hawaiian or aloha shirt, this casual type shirt is loose fitting, short-sleeved and features a convertible collar with a rever. Make it up in a border print or traditional floral print fabric__.  
_

_Take the following measurements of your man: chest, neck, arm length and finished length (usually hip level)._

_**Note:** 3/8″ seam allowance is included in draft_

**Working Scale = 1/3 chest measurement + 6″ (15.5 cm)**

_example: for a men’s medium size the scale = 42/3 + 6 = 20_

**[PLOT EACH POINT & CONNECT-THE-DOTS](https://wkdesigner.wordpress.com/2007/09/14/connect-the-dots/shirt2/ "shirt2")**

_Mark point 0 and square both ways from it._

_1 from 0 = ½ scale + 1″ (25 mm)_

_2 from 0 = ¼ scale_

_3 from 0 = 1/8 scale_

_4 from 0 = full length (30″/ 76 cm)_

_5 from 4 = 1 ½” (40 mm) for turn up._

_Square all points across the paper._[](https://wkdesigner.wordpress.com/2007/09/14/connect-the-dots/shirt-draft/ "shirt draft")

_8 from 1 = 1/3 scale + 2 ½” (65mm); square up to locate 9 and 10._

_11 from 10 = 1″ (25mm)_

_12 squared from 11 = 1″ (25 mm); join 7 to 12._

_13 from 1 = 2/3 of half the chest measurement + 2″ (50mm)_

_14 from 1 = ½ of chest measurement + 2 ¾” (70 mm)_

_15 from 14 is midway between 13 and 14; square up to 16._

_16 from 15 = ½ scale + 2 ¼” (58 mm); join 16 to 10._

_17 is the distance between 7 and 12 – ¼” (6 mm) and is located on line 16-10._

_Join 17 to 13; 18 from 17 = 1 ¼” (32 mm) and is located on line 17-13._

_19 is midway 8 and 13; square down to locate 21 at hemline._

_20 from 19 = 1 ¼” (32mm)_[![](https://wkdesigner.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/alohafunwear_1962_6402209.gif?w=309&h=264)

_Join 20 to 22 for forepart side seam._

_23 is located at intersection of hemline and centerfront (CF) line._

_24 from 23 = ¾” (20 mm); shape front hem from 24 to 22 with 90° corners as shown._

_25 is located at intersection of lines squared from 16 and 14._

_26 from 16 = 1/12 scale + ¾” (20mm)_

_27 from 25 = 1/6 scale_

_Connect 26 and 27 and continue 1 ½” (40 mm) more to locate 28._

_29 from 16 = ¾” (20 mm) for collar stand and creaseline of rever._

_30 and 32 are each 1 ½” (40 mm) from CF line (overlap extension) as shown._

_31 from 30 = 1″ (25 mm); join 31 to 29 to indicate roll-line of rever._

_33 from 27 = ½” (13mm) for collar step._

_Fold along line 28-32; trace out front shoulder, front neckline and front hem._

_Shape self-facing as shown, making it 3″ 75 mm) wide at hem and blending uo to the shoulder for 1 ½” (40 mm). Note: The gray-shaded area should be interfaced._
