Connection Club

Connection Club invites you to step into a dedicated practice of making and maintaining friendships and building community in adulthood. The club is designed for people who want to be more intentional and committed to their goals of cultivating connection in an ongoing way, and they want to do it in community with other connection geeks. Cancel anytime.

When we first started in 2020, we were a community centered on the practice of nurturing friendships through the art of letter-writing. **This time, we exist to help you manifest the connection goals you set for yourself.**

*   Each month we’ll have a **community gathering**. You’ll bring the connection goal that you have for the month ahead. You’ll receive gentle accountability by sharing your goal with the large group and you’ll get encouragement and idea-generation (if desired) in your **small groups.**
    
*   Each gathering will also include a **discussion circle or short workshop** based on topics that community members want to explore and/or develop more skills in.
    
*   There will also be opportunities for group members to practice their **facilitation skills in a supportive environment** by leading portions of the program (I’m here to support you with this.) Along the way, we’ll be sharing our progress, stumbles, lessons, and successes with each other.
    

We are a Community for Connection Catalyzers

These are the kinds of goals we set:

*   “I want to cultivate connections by doing more leading and deepening. For the past two years, I’ve joined many different groups, and I’d like to be more of an organizer and facilitator this year.”
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “I’m thinking about how I attune to the overall health of my relational diversity. Seeing where there’s lack and overabundance. Getting more fulfillment from having a variety of relationship types.”
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “I want to add people to my life that make my life better. I’m interested in honest conversations, sharing space, and building on our mutual interests.”
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “I really connected with what you said in the newsletter about being more of a Joiner this year. I want to do that too. I’m tired of being the planner and facilitator of most gatherings for my group of friends.”
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “I want the option to spend time with friends simply Being Together. Not necessarily having structure or agendas, but just a free spontaneous time being together.”
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “I want to grow my skills as a facilitator this year. I have this dream of running peer groups, and volunteering to provide the community with mutual aid.”
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “I want to deepen my existing friendships by adding novelty to our interactions—conversations over coffee or a meal are great, but I’d like to have new experiences with my friends, whether through an activity neither of us has done, going to a place we’ve never been, or discussing topics outside our usual.”
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “This year I want to focus on building a community of curious humans who can introduce me to new ideas, inspire me, and maybe even build new things with me.”
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether your connection goals are itty bitty baby steps or big, bold, audacious leaps into the unknown, I’m here to support you. And you’ll have an entire community behind you, encouraging you to create the beautiful realities you’re wishing for.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there’s something connection-related that’s important to you (like a friendship that’s fizzling, a community you’re trying to get off the ground as a facilitator, or the throes of excitement that come with a brand new friendship that you really hope lasts) — _bring it._

*   We are a group for adults (18+) who want to belong to a supportive community while you work on your personal goals of creating more fulfilling experiences of friendship and community in your life. For some people the goal might be smaller, like simply getting support while you try out new ideas with your existing friends. For other folks, the goal might be larger, like learning facilitation skills and practicing convening groups. No matter where you’re at and what your connection goals are, we’re here to support you in making it a reality.
    
*   More than 61% of Americans report feeling lonely on a regular basis, and it’s not because they lack people around them. For a variety of reasons (I explain the biggest culprits in my book We Should Get Together: The Secret to Cultivating Better Friendships), we often struggle to create and maintain connections with friends and community members during our busy grownup lives.
    
    It makes a huge difference when you have an accountability group — it can give you ideas and inspiration, be a safe place to talk about your hopes, confess your sadness when your connection attempts don’t work out, and give you the motivation to keep trying again the next month.
    
*   In the beginning, we’ll start out with an intimit-ish group. But even as we grow larger, you’ll always feel a closer connection because you’ll get lots of time with a smaller group of people during our live calls.
    
    You’ll never just be a number or an anonymous face in a crowd. That’s not how any of my gatherings or groups are. I prioritize designing and creating a space where each person can feel welcome, and where each person can feel at ease and find a sense of belonging.
    
*   We're starting out open-ended. You can start and stop whenever you like. I’ll evaluate the program at the six-month mark to see if we should keep going or wind down if members feel like they’ve accomplished their goals.
    
    Once open enrollment starts, people will be able to join at any time, so there will likely always be a set of people that are actively working on their goals and wanting support with that. So we’re likely to continue for a long time. I never say that any of my programs will “last forever” though, since I probably have other plans for when I’m 89 years old. It’s gotta end sometime! ;)
    
*   Since the majority of my audience is in the US, time zones will be optimized for US time zones, and can be flexible depending on the location of the members. This is why I didn’t specify meeting times in advance. Times will be based on the needs of the group, and monthly call times will likely shift to make it flexible and fair to a variety of group members.
    
*   The primary commitment is the monthly gathering, and that is a synchronous event. One thing I’ve learned is that adults do better with a bit of flexibility around their commitments. For that reason, the synchronous expectations for this group are intentionally minimal — we will have a single synchronous monthly gathering, which folks are expected to show up for either via audio or video.
    
    Once we hang up, you get to action. Executing your goals will happen asynchronously around whatever your schedule needs and how chill or ambitious your goals are.
    
    In between our live calls, you have to option to stay in touch, ask questions, or share info on your progress. How much you participate in asynchronous posts is based entirely on your needs, preferences, and energy. You’ll have the option, but never any pressure.
    

Don’t just take my word for it.

Here’s what a few participants at my past groups and programs have to say:

*   “This circle was a time to practice vulnerability and openness. It was also a great way to get support for things that are important and deserve time and attention.”
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   "I greatly appreciate the support, encouragement, and clarity you gave me. It was a major shift; one that I’m so happy to have made.”
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “Do it. You’ll learn so much and Kat is an awesome facilitator. The other people in the circle are great too because they also want to connect.”
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   "It's both introvert and extrovert friendly, so all will enjoy it. And the members are kind and bring positive energy.”
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “I already referred a friend — I told her this seemed like something she’d be interested in and that we could do ‘together’ even though we live in different states now.”
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   "As an introvert, I was very nervous leading up to the event but really enjoyed myself. I really liked the ability to talk in small groups as I tend to struggle to take space in larger groups. Kat was an amazing facilitator and really helped set the tone."
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   “Do it! We need meaningful human connections now more than ever.”
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    
*   "Great facilitation and structure from someone who has led hundreds of facilitated strategy workshops - nicely done. You kept pace, engagement, and timed breakouts sufficiently. And you ended right on time! Great screen presence and warmth from Kat."
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
