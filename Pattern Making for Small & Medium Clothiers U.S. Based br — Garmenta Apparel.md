ENGINEERING THE PERFECT FIT
===========================

### PATTERN MAKING FOR ESTABLISHED CLOTHIERS

To you, clothing isn’t just your passion, but your business. 

You could spend hours drawing and draping, conceptualizing and re-imagining the next big idea. You’re always thinking about your customers, especially when it comes to making your company more size-inclusive. Your garment line is more than your business — it’s your life’s work..

I get it, because your garment line is my life’s work, too. While you obsess over color choices and fabric, I obsess over drape and fit. I think through every detail to make sure your garments fit every size perfectly. I spend hours troubleshooting how to turn your brilliant idea into reality. We both imagine your customer trying on and falling in love with your clothes — so much that they come back season after season, year after year. 

We make an exceptional team, don’t we?

The Pattern Making Process
--------------------------

#### INQUIRY —

You’re looking for a partner to help you turn your sketches into production-ready patterns, and reach out. You’ll share your vision and the outcomes you’re looking for.

#### PLANNING — 

We will discuss your needs, supporting materials, and production plan to create a tailor made plan of action that aligns with your expectations and your workflow.

#### PATTERN MAKING —

Using your sketches, tech pack, inside knowledge of your design process, and the best software in the biz, I’ll create your size-inclusive patterns. It sounds easy when you read it like that, but it takes lots of troubleshooting, engineering, and decades of experience to get it right so quickly. 

#### REVIEW—

When I complete the first draft of your pattern, you’ll get a digital file or a hard copy mailed to your studio. Whether you sew the samples your self or work with a sampling partner, everything is clearly marked for ease of use. You will give me any feedback on the fit and I’ll fine tune from here.

#### DELIVERY —

Once you’ve given the patterns your seal of approval and they have been graded, the digital pattern files will hit your inbox instantly.

### _“Her technical expertise helps me develop a clear vision of my brand’s evolution, and delivers a consistency of fit in my clothing that keeps my customers happy”_

About the Pattern Pro
=====================

I’m Betsy Cook (she/her), and while I consider myself to be a pattern maker, many have called me the “pattern fixer.” It’s not a real job title, of course, but when you have a reputation for being experienced and precise, people tend to ask you for help when their pattern making has gone wrong. And when you work for massive fashion retailers who outsource pattern making overseas, that tends to be a common problem. I’ve been responsible for fixing the fit or core structure of hundreds of garments, representing multi-million dollar investments. Reverse engineering in a high-pressure, fast-paced environment like that really teaches you how to engineer things correctly the first time around. And now, that’s my specialty. 

Answers to your questions
-------------------------

#### What kind of patterns do you make?

I offer professional pattern making services for ready-to-wear womens, mens, childrens and plus size apparel. Making your apparel line size inclusive is my speciality.

#### Where are you located?

My studio is based in Hendersonville, North Carolina, USA, but all pattern making is done remotely. Isn’t the internet awesome?!

#### How long does pattern making take?

Pattern making is billed per hour, with most projects taking around two hours. Pattern turn-around time is roughly 2 – 3 weeks. If that feels fast, that’s because it is. I limit the number of apparel brands that I work with so that each one can be prioritized.  

#### Do you make samples?

No. However, the patterns you receive will be easy to use and comprehensive for your sample-making procedures, whether you make the sample yourself and have your factory do it.

#### Can you make me a custom garment?

No. My services are for mass production.

#### Can you work with my existing files?

Absolutely, as long as they have a .DXF, .PDS, or .AI file extension. 

  

I’m precise, I’m fast, and I’m experienced, so I know your garments will fit perfectly once we’ve worked together. But pattern making is intensely personal work, so it’s important that we as business owners fit, too. I’m excited to hear the big places your clothing brand is going and how I can help you get there.
