**ASSEMBLY**

**1.** Iron fusible interfacing to back (wrong side) of bag pieces following manufacturer’s directions, except for strap pieces.

**2.** **Make up bag straps**. With right sides together (RST), fold strap pieces in half lengthwise and sew along long edge. Press seam open. Align the short ends so that the seam is centered in the middle of the strap width. Stitch across one end only. Trim corners. Turn straps RIGHT SIDE OUT. Press flat with long seam at center. [Topstitch](http://missourifamilies.org/learningopps/learnmaterial/dictionary/stu.htm) around perimeter of straps if desired. On open end, attach a metal belt tip on long strap and a buckle/slider on the short strap. Set aside.

**3.** **Prepare bag lining.** On the patch pocket, turn under the top edge ¼” \[6mm\] and press. Turn top edge once more: ¾” \[20mm\] and stitch down. Turn and press seam allowance on remaining three sides.

With one of the bag lining pieces FACE UP, center the patch pocket and [edge-stitch](http://missourifamilies.org/learningopps/learnmaterial/dictionary/def.htm) along pocket sides and bottom.

With RST, center-align and match flap facing to top of body lining piece.

With RST, align and match remaining bag lining piece to this lining section. Stitch side seams and press open.

Stitch 2” \[50mm\] on each end of the bottom seam; then align the side seam to the bottom seam and sew across the seams to create a [miter](http://missourifamilies.org/learningopps/learnmaterial/dictionary/mno.htm). Set aside.

4\. Prepare flap pocket.** Begin by aligning the zipper facing with the top of the flap, right sides together.  Stitch an outline of the pocket opening equal to the **length of the zipper teeth X half the zipper’s width**.

(_eg. 12 inches_ **X** _⅜”_ **+** _seam allowance_)

Carefully clip diagonally at the corners of the stitching and turn the zipper facing FACE UP. Press seam flat.

With the flap piece FACE UP, align and center the zipper FACE UP in the indentation. [Edge-stitch](http://missourifamilies.org/learningopps/learnmaterial/dictionary/def.htm) around pocket opening to secure the zipper.

With RST, sew one pocket bag piece to the bottom edge of the zipper facing.

Flip the lining downward and [topstitch](http://missourifamilies.org/learningopps/learnmaterial/dictionary/stu.htm) along the seam.

With flap piece FACE DOWN, align and match remaining pocket bag piece to top of zipper. Stitch zipper to lining; then stitch sides of pocket bag.

Trim the excess from the lining on the bottom of the pocket bag and sew bottom seam. Set aside.
