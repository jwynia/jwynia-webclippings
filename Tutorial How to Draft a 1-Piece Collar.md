# Tutorial: How to Draft a 1-Piece Collar
A 1-piece collar, you say? Why in the world would I want to make/use one of those crazy-looking things?

The first few shirts I made for my husband I did not use a I-piece collar pattern. What was the point, after all? Well, in time, I realized that eliminating the seam on the front edge of the collar produces a smoother line. And the collar and the front placket is your **first impression** of a shirt. Uh huh. So make it count, people.

Also, my husband loves a good button-down, and eliminating some of the bulk in the collar point area enabled me to create a better-looking buttonhole. Â OK, so far that’s 2 points for a 1-piece collar.

What about the downsides? Well, you have to draft it yourself, usually. I don’t believe I have ever seen a pattern with this piece included. Now, I haven’t seen every pattern produced (my husband would disagree, based on the size of my pattern stash!), but for sure it is not the norm in a shirt pattern.

Because the shape is a little wonky, a 1-piece collar requires a bit more fabric thanÂ the more typical upper collar and under collar pattern pieces. It just doesn’t fit easily into the little sections of fabric that are often “reserved” for collars, cuffs, and other fiddly little who-ha’s.

Alright. That’s 2 for, and 2 against; a wash. Let’s talk about how you can draft your own 1-piece collar, and you can decide when/where you want to use it.

1.Â  Trace aÂ new, full size copy ofÂ your **upper** collar pattern piece, and draw the stitching lines on both of the front collar edges.  
2.Â  Trace 2 copies of the **under** collar pattern piece, and draw the stitching lines on both of the collar front edges.

3.Â  Lay the under collar pieces on top of the upper collar piece, **aligning the stitching lines**. Make sure that the collar point end of the under collar is attached tot eh collar point end of the upper collar. Tape to secure.  
4.Â  Trim da “wings”. ![](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f642.svg)

In the image above,Â the collar pattern is folded on the front edges, and you are looking atÂ  the **under** collar folded on top of the upper collar. You can see the overlap of the under collar pieces at the center back, right? Of course those 2 pieces are seamed during construction, but this shows you how the weird flying bird-shaped pattern piece actually looks like a collar when it is sewn.

That’s pretty much all there is to it.Â  Actually, really simple pattern drafting, right?

One more thing. I like to shave a bit off the collar edgeÂ (closest to the bottom in this image) and the center back of the **under** **collar only**. Why?Â Because the under collar isÂ on the bias and willÂ “grow” a bit. Since I want the under collar to actually be **under** the upper collar, it helps to reduce the dimensions of this pattern piece slightly. Only logical, right?

Oh, I guess there is anotherÂ thing. It will save you timeÂ if you also draft a separate interfacing pattern piece for this collar. I like the interfacing pattern piece toÂ cover **onlyÂ**the upper collar section, and **not** extend onto the under collar at the fold. Less bulk which keeps that front edge fold smooth and perfect. Again, only logical.

For another tutorial on this subject (and a glimpse of my cute DH!), you can check out my Craftsy post on [How to Make a One-Piece Shirt Collar](http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/11/how-to-make-a-shirt-collar/).

Or, if you prefer, you can watch a quick, little video I made to demo this process.

Have you ever drafted/sewn a 1-piece collar? What did you like about using a single collar piece compared to a separate under and upper collar piece?

Happy sewing!
